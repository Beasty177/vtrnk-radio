    <h1>VTRNK Radio Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: September 20, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>VTRNK Radio is a mobile application developed by Beasty Beats for streaming internet radio. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information within the VTRNK Radio app. The app does not collect or share personal data, such as your name, email, or location, and does not use cookies or tracking technologies.</p>

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following data to enhance your experience:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>App Preferences</strong>: We store settings such as language (English, Russian, Spanish, French, Hebrew), vibration, adaptive background, cover art loading, equalizer display, and extended track info display locally on your device using SharedPreferences. This data is not transmitted to any servers or third parties.</li>
        <li><strong>App Functionality</strong>: The app uses the system URL launcher to open external links (e.g., Telegram channels <a href="https://t.me/vtornikshow">t.me/vtornikshow</a>, <a href="https://t.me/beastybeats23">t.me/beastybeats23</a>, video stream <a href="https://vtrnk.online/stream.html">vtrnk.online/stream.html</a>, and Privacy Policy <a href="https://beasty177.github.io/vtrnk-radio/privacy_policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>). The launcher queries installed apps to determine if Telegram or a browser can handle these links. No information from this query is stored or shared.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Usage</h2>
    <p>The data we collect is used solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide a personalized user experience (e.g., saving your preferred language or settings).</li>
        <li>Enable seamless navigation to external links for Telegram channels, video streaming, and Privacy Policy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use analytics, tracking, cookies, or advertising services. No data is shared with third parties.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>All data (app preferences) is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to external servers. We do not have access to this data. The app uses secure HTTPS connections for WebSocket and HTTP requests to fetch public track metadata (artist, title, cover art) from <a href="https://vtrnk.online">vtrnk.online</a>, but no user-specific information is included in these requests.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app integrates with the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Telegram</strong>: Links to Telegram channels are opened using the system URL launcher, which may check if the Telegram app is installed.</li>
        <li><strong>VTRNK Online</strong>: Links to the video stream and track metadata are fetched from <a href="https://vtrnk.online">vtrnk.online</a>, operated by Beasty Beats.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No personal data is shared with these services.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. Any updates will be posted here, and the effective date will be revised.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, contact us at <a href="mailto:dmitrycherchencev@gmail.com">dmitrycherchencev@gmail.com</a> or via our Telegram channel <a href="https://t.me/beastybeats23">t.me/beastybeats23</a>.</p>
